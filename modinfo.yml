name: Chase The Crown | Game Mode
version: 1.0.0
description: | 
  The Player who hits 4 perfect notes in a row gets the crown. The crown gives a 1.1x score multiplier. The multiplier will be increased every Phrase the Player owns the crown by 0.1x until the Max Multiplier (1.5x) is reached. Short Notes will be ignored, because they can be tricky to hit.
  The Players without the Crown don't have a multiplier.

  All these values can be adjusted.
